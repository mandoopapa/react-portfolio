      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jae Seong Lee. My vision is Full-Stack Blockchain Developer. As a business major, I looked at the future of IT technology while working and learning in various fields such as startups, non-profit organizations, and manufacturing. In the future society, I believe that the technology of trust will lead the future. So, I recently changed my career path as a blockchain developer and am focusing on development studies. Now I studying Javascript and Reactjs for Front-End. I upload and manage what I have studied on GitHub. Fork various open sources, analyze and study. I update series such as Go Lang basics on my IT blog. Also, I am posting a 'Development Diary Road to Developer' that I upload every day, which contains the progress of my growth as a developer. Thank you!",

Our team analyzes the basic blockchain trilemma and utilizes three technologies: Stella Consensus Protocol, Zero Knowledge-STARKs, and Ricardian Contract. We proposed a PoDC algorithm that modified the Stellar consensus algorithm, and proposed and announced a blockchain-based voting system using it.",

Our team proposed an Olympic scoring system with the goal of reclaiming the Olympic Games, a festival that can be trusted by people around the world by applying the technology of trust based on the idea from the judgment controversy at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Visualize the judges' scorecard with Marbles, the property of the Hyperledger Fabric Marbles Demo. The goal was to implement a reliable scoring system by allowing a transaction to be generated and recorded on the ledger whenever a player is scored.",
